# NLP-Sentiment-Analysis

A simple example of sentiment analysis using naive_bayes (BernoulliNB) classifier from SKLearn.

### Libs
- SKLearn ([https://www.nltk.org/](https://www.nltk.org/))
- NLTK ([http://scikit-learn.org/stable/](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/))

### Training

In order to train a new model just run the `sentiment.py` script.

```BASH
python sentiment.py
```

In the code you'll see many lines commented. They are other classifier than can be used from the SKLearn Libs.

### Test

In order to test the model run the `test.py` script.

```BASH
python test.py
```

Ofcourse you can change the text you want to test, just modify the `test` vector from line [[7](https://github.com/blasvicco/NLP-Sentiment-Analysis/blob/bf731dc9a8655bc1964564f2b576b9a60db7dc23/test.py#L7)]
